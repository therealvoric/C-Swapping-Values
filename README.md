C-Swapping-Values
This repository contains C code that demonstrates two different approaches to swap the values of two variables. The first approach is to pass the variables by value to a function, while the second approach is to pass the variables by reference (i.e., as pointers) to a function.

Getting Started
To run this code, you will need a C compiler. You can compile the code using a terminal by navigating to the directory where the code is saved and typing the following command:

gcc -o swapping swapping.c

This will compile the code and create an executable file called "swapping". You can then run the executable by typing:

./swapping

This will run the program and output the values of the variables before and after they are swapped using both approaches.

Contributing
